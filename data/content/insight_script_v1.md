# [Insight] 구조조정 공시 5건 폭발! '망하는 기업 vs 줍줍할 기업' 리스트 공개

## Opening (Context)
Today, the Hoin Engine has detected a **L3 Structural Anomaly** driven by a sudden surge in corporate asset disposal filings (DART). Unlike typical price volatility, this indicates a **fundamental shift in corporate liquidity conditions**.

## Why Now
*   **Trigger**: 'Disposal of Asset' filings reached **5 counts** in a single scan window (Threshold: >2).
*   **Timing**: This cluster of filings coincides with a **Structural** market phase, suggesting forced selling or strategic restructuring rather than routine operations.
*   **Significance**: Historically, such clusters precede sector-wide M&A consolidations or liquidity crunches in the manufacturing sector.

## What Changed
*   **Data Signal**: The `struct_dart_disposal` metric shifted from **Inactive** to **L2/L3 Alert**.
*   **Market Context**: KOSPI foreign flow is neutral, meaning domestic corporations are acting independently of macro liquidity—a classic "Structural" signal.

## What to Watch (Strategy)
*   **Action**: Monitor the specific tickers associated with these filings (to be listed in the data view).
*   **Risk**: If disposal filings continue for >3 days, expect a **Credit Spread** widening event.
*   **Opportunity**: Look for "value-up" candidates among firms with healthy balance sheets acquiring these distressed assets.

## Closing
This is a **Cold Start** detection, meaning the engine picked up this signal purely from bottom-up data without a top-down macro regime. Pay attention to the *micro-structure* of the market today.
