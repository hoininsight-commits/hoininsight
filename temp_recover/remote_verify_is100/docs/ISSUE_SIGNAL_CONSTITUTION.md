# ISSUE_SIGNAL_CONSTITUTION (v1.0)

## 1. Definition
**IssueSignal** is the real-time TRIGGER and CONTENT engine that identifies "Why Now" market shifts, while **HoinEngine** serves as the immutable DATA & EVIDENCE supplier.

## 2. Core Philosophy (Eye / Knowledge / Mouth)
- **IssueSignal (The Senses)**: The Eye (Monitoring), Knowledge (Logic), and Mouth (Narrative).
- **HoinEngine (The Library)**: The Evidence Supplier and Grounding Source.

## 3. Two-Stage Workflow
IssueSignal operates in a strict sequence to ensure speed and accuracy:

### Stage A: FAST Trigger & Gate (Minutes)
- **Goal**: Immediate capture of high-impact global signals.
- **Process**: Scan Issue Pool -> Capture Signal -> Fast Why-Now Validation.
- **Latency**: Sub-5 minutes from trigger capture to gate decision.

### Stage B: DEEP Evidence Ingestion
- **Goal**: Ground the signal in structural reality.
- **Process**: Query HoinEngine (Read-Only) -> Pull Evidence Anchors -> Map Ticker Bottlenecks.
- **Constraint**: No signal proceeds without a valid HoinEngine evidence match.

## 4. Operational Rules [IMMUTABLE]
1. **Ticker Limit**: Exactly 1–3 real tickers per issue. No more, no less.
2. **Rejection Policy**: If evidence is weak or tickers exceed 3, the issue MUST be rejected.
3. **Safety**: Mandatory Kill-Switch integration for every output.
4. **Read-Only**: IssueSignal never modifies HoinEngine data or logic.
