# (Economic Hunter – Step 7)

## 0. Purpose

This engine translates the
Rigid Logic (Step 1~6)
into
Human Narrative (Step 7).

It does not add new facts.
It only compresses the "Why" into a format
that a non-expert can understand in 60 seconds.

## 1. Input Requirements

Input:
- LOCKED_TICKER_CARD (from Step 5)
- LIFECYCLE_STATUS = ACTIVE (from Step 6)

If input is not LOCKED → REJECT.

## 2. Headline Grammar (The 1-Line Rule)

The headline must follow this strict structure:

> **[Pressure Source]** forces **[Industry]** to buy **[Bottleneck]** immediately.

Examples:
- (O) "IMO Carbon Rules force Shipowners to buy Ammonia Engines immediately."
- (O) "AI Power Shortage forces Utilities to buy UHV Transformers immediately."
- (X) "Why HD Hyundai is a good stock" (Recommendation)
- (X) "Transformer Super Cycle is coming" (Vague Theme)

Constraint:
- No emotional adjectives (Super, Great, Huge) ❌
- No question marks (?) ❌
- Must be a statement of causality ⭕

## 3. Script Structure (The 60-Second Block)

The script connects the dots in exactly 4 sentences.

### Block 1: The Trigger (Why Now?) — 15s
"Right now, **[Trigger Event]** has confirmed that **[Old Assumption]** is broken."
*e.g., "The US Department of Energy just confirmed that transformer lead times have hit 40 months."*

### Block 2: The Structural Flow (Who Must Spend?) — 15s
"This forces **[Forced Spender]** to spend budget on **[Forced Capex]**, regardless of the economic cycle."
*e.g., "This forces Utility companies to replace grid infrastructure immediately to prevent blackouts."*

### Block 3: The Bottleneck (Where Does Money Go?) — 15s
"The problem is, this capital can only flow to **[Bottleneck Entity]** because **[Defense Moat]**."
*e.g., "The problem is, only 3 companies in the world have the certification to supply these UHV transformers."*

### Block 4: The Kill-Switch (Safety Valve) — 15s
"Watch this one variable: **[Kill-Switch Condition]**. If this breaks, the thesis ends instantly."
*e.g., "Watch the US import ban policy. If Chinese imports are allowed, this thesis ends instantly."*

[NARRATIVE_CARD]
- **Headline**: (Strict Grammar)
- **Audio Script**: (4-Block Text)
- **Tone**: Clinical / Urgent / Objective

## 5. Rejection Criteria

The Narrative Engine REJECTS if:
- It requires >4 sentences to explain.
- It relies on "Generic Growth" instead of "Forced Spending."
- It mocks a Kill-Switch that is vague (e.g., "If market crashes" -> Invalid).

## 6. Absolute Prohibitions

- "To the moon" / "Rocket" emojis ❌
- "Undervalued" / "Cheap" ❌
- "Buy zone" / "Target price" ❌
- Hype / FOMO induction ❌

This engine produces
**Evidence-based Logic**, not Sales Copy.
