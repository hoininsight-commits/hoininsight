# BOTTLENECK_COLLAPSE_ENGINE.md
# (Economic Hunter – Step 4)

## 0. Purpose

This engine collapses
a verified Structural Necessity
into unavoidable bottlenecks.

If spending can diffuse across many players,
the Topic must be rejected.

---

## 1. Input Requirements

Input must be:
- STRUCTURAL_VERDICT = PASS
from STRUCTURAL_NECESSITY_ENGINE

No speculative or future assumptions allowed.

---

## 2. Bottleneck Definition

A bottleneck is defined as a node where:

- Failure blocks the entire system
- Replacement is not immediate
- Scale cannot be ramped quickly
- Alternatives exist only on paper

If substitution is feasible → INVALID

---

## 3. Bottleneck Qualification Tests

At least TWO of the following must be TRUE:

1. Lead-time Constraint (≥ 12 months)
2. Capacity Ceiling (fixed or saturated)
3. Regulatory / Certification Lock
4. Physical Infrastructure Dependency
5. Technological Complexity Barrier
6. Skilled Labor Scarcity
7. Sovereign / National Restriction

If fewer than 2 → REJECT

---

## 4. Collapse Rule

Valid outputs must collapse to:

- Minimum: 1 bottleneck
- Maximum: 3 bottlenecks

0 → No bottleneck → INVALID  
≥4 → Diffused theme → INVALID

---

## 5. Time Pressure Gate

Bottleneck impact must manifest within:

- 0–18 months

Long-term (2–5 years) themes are forbidden.

---

## 6. Output Format

[BOTTLENECK_VERDICT]

- Bottleneck Name (generic, non-company)
- Why it cannot be bypassed
- What breaks without it
- Time-to-failure if delayed

No company names allowed at this stage.

---

## 7. Absolute Prohibitions

- Company guessing ❌
- Sector labeling ❌
- Trend extrapolation ❌
- Market narrative ❌

This engine isolates pressure,
not beneficiaries.
