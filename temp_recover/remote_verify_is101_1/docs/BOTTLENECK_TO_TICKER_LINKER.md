- Are already delivering the bottleneck
- Are operating at commercial scale
- Have verifiable installations or contracts

Forbidden:
- Lab-stage companies
- Pilot-only deployments

---

## 3. Reality Filter (5-Point Kill Test)

Each candidate is evaluated on:

1. Commercial revenue existence
2. Actual delivery / installation record
3. Regulatory or certification clearance
4. Production capacity at scale
5. Lead-time feasibility (within demand window)

Failing ≥2 → ELIMINATED
