# ECONOMIC HUNTER TOPIC DNA

**Establishment Date:** 2026-01-29
**Purpose:** To define the STRICT, NON-NEGOTIABLE eligibility rules for any topic covered by the "Economic Hunter" channel.

---

## 1. The Core Definition
The Economic Hunter does NOT cover "news" or "stock trends."
We cover **"Structural Capital Migrations triggered by Irreversible Events."**

If a topic does not force a reallocation of capital by institutional giants, it is noise. We do not hunt noise. We hunt the **inevitable**.

---

## 2. Mandatory Conditions (The Hard Gate)
A topic MUST satisfy ALL THREE conditions to pass the DNA test.

### Rule 1: The "Why Now" Trigger (Time-Bound Irreversibility)
The topic must be triggered by a specific, recent event that makes the change **irreversible**.
*   **Must Be:** A policy change, a technological breakthrough (with release), a supply shock, or a geopolitical forcing function.
*   **Must NOT Be:** "People are talking about X," "Stock Y is rising," or "Z sector looks promising."
*   **Test:** Can you name the exact *date* or *event* that pulled the trigger? If not, REJECT.

### Rule 2: Structural Flow (The Macroscopic Tsunami)
The capital flow must be driven by **necessity**, not sentiment.
*   **Must Be:** Governments *must* spend this budget, Corporations *must* buy this equipment to survive, Consumers *have no choice* but to switch.
*   **Must NOT Be:** "This product is cool," "Sales might improve," "Competitor X is weak."
*   **Test:** If the stock market crashes tomorrow, does this capital flow *still happen*? If yes, PASS.

### Rule 3: The "Inevitable Collapse" (1~3 Winners)
The structural wave must channel efficiently into a bottleneck of **1 to 3 companies**.
*   **Must Be:** A monopoly, a duopoly, or a value chain where *all roads lead to this supplier*.
*   **Must NOT Be:** A fragmented market with 10+ players, a "winner takes all" gamble where the winner is unknown, or a generic ETF play.
*   **Test:** If the industry grows 10x, is it *mathematically impossible* for this company NOT to grow?

## 3. The Anti-Pattern (What We NEVER Cover)
Any topic appearing on this list is immediately **REJECTED**, regardless of profit potential.

1.  **Sentiment/Meme Stocks:** Driven by retail hope, not structural necessity.
2.  **Pure Valuation Plays:** "It's too cheap" is not a thesis. It's a trap.
3.  **Binary Biotech/Pharma:** Gambling on a single FDA approval without a structural platform.
4.  **Generic Macro Fears:** "Recession is coming" (unless identifying the *one* asset that wins in recession).
5.  **Political Gossip:** Election *speculation* (unless a law is *passed*).
6.  **"Me-Too" Products:** The 5th company to launch an AI LLM.

## 4. The Operator's Checklist
Before approving ANY topic (PASS -> LOCK), the Human Operator (Economic Hunter) must answer YES to these three questions.

*   [ ] **1. The Trigger:** Is there a confirmed event (Law, Capex Announcement, Shock) within the last 30 days that started this?
*   [ ] **2. The Necessity:** Is the customer *forced* to spend money here due to survival or law? (Not just because they want to).
*   [ ] **3. The Bottleneck:** Can I name the 1 or 2 companies that *control* this choke point?

**If any answer is NO, the topic is REJECTED.**
