# TRIGGER_UNIVERSE & ISSUE POOL (v1.0)

## 1. The Trigger Universe
IssueSignal monitors the following global categories to capture high-impact signals:

| Category | Primary Sources | Signal Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Central Bank** | Fed, ECB, BoJ, FOMC Minutes | Rate path, Liquidity shifts, Policy tone |
| **Global Summits** | Davos, G7/G20, COP | Structural trends, Multi-lateral shifts |
| **Policy & Regs** | DART, SEC, Legislative filings | Tariffs, Export controls, Antitrust |
| **Corporate Guidance** | Earnings Calls, Capex plans | Bottlenecks, Demand shifts, Inventory |
| **Supply-Chain** | Freight rates, Yield reports | Physical bottlenecks, Lead-time shocks |
| **Market Shock** | VIX, Volatility spikes | Price-driven liquidity traps |

## 2. The Issue Pool Concept
The **Issue Pool** is a transient storage area where raw signals await validation.

- **Status: UNKNOWN**: Freshly captured signals that haven't passed the gate.
- **Incubation**: Signals are held here. If a "Why Now" trigger doesn't occur within the relevance window, the signal is expired.
- **Deduplication**: Multiple sources reporting the same event are collapsed into a single Issue Pool entry.

## 3. Signal Filtering Rules
- **Impact Threshold**: Signals must have a direct structural or capital flow implication.
- **Specificity**: Generic news (e.g., "Market up/down") is filtered out.
- **Actor Clarity**: Signals must clearly point to a sector, commodity, or specific technological bottleneck.
