    "condition": "**The Lead-Time/Order Book Fixation Ratio (LT/OFR)**",
    "meaning": "This sensor directly measures the duration (T) capital is guaranteed to remain fixed. A 48-month lead time means the capital flow associated with that unit is temporally locked, making the revenue stream highly predictable and insulating the sector from short-term macro economic contraction risk. It proves policy execution is overriding macro uncertainty."
