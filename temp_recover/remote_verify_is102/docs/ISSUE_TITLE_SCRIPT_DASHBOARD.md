# (Economic Hunter – Step 9)

## 0. Purpose

This engine packages the harvested issue (Step 8)
into the final output format for the Human Operator (Economic Hunter).

It ensures:
- Titles are Structural, not Clickbait.
- Scripts are Logical, not Emotional.
- Dashboard Cards are Actionable, not decorative.

---

## 1. Title Generator Rules

Titles must gain attention through **Logic Conflict**, not Hype.

### Forbidden Words (Immediate Reject)
- 전망 (Outlook)
- 가능성 (Possibility)
- 주목 (Attention)
- 기대 (Expectation)
- 대박/수혜 (Jackpot/Benefit)
- 급등 (Surge)

### Mandatory Components (Pick ≥2)
1. **Time Pressure (T)**: "D-day", "Deadline", "Tonight"
2. **Numeric Constraint (N)**: "0%", "Sold Out", "3 Years"
3. **Structural Collision (S)**: "Vs", "Block", "Force"
4. **Forced Action (A)**: "Must", "Ban", "Replace"

### Title Formula
> "Because of **[T/S]**, **[Subject]** has no choice but to **[A]**."

*Example:*
- (X) "AI Industry Expected to Grow" (Vague)
- (O) "Power Grid Failure forces US Utilities to bypass Regulations." (Structural)

## 2. Script Skeleton (Fixed 5-Step)

Every script MUST follow this exact flow. No improvisation.

### [Step 1] THE HOOK (The Conflict) - 10s
Start with a fact that contradicts market mood.
> "While everyone is looking at [Common Theme], real money is stuck at [Bottleneck]."

### [Step 2] THE MISUNDERSTANDING (Why It Feels Early) - 10s
Explain why the stock price hasn't reacted yet.
> "The market thinks this is [Temporary Issue], but [New Data/Law] proves it is irreversible."

### [Step 3] THE STRUCTURE (Forced Flow) - 15s
Identify the forced spender.
> "Legally/Physically, [Spender] has 0 choice. They must buy [Asset] to survive [Deadline]."

### [Step 4] THE CAPITAL FLOW (The Bottleneck) - 15s
Identify the only beneficiary.
> "This budget has nowhere to go but [Ticker 1...3] because [Moat/Capacity Lock]."

### [Step 5] THE KILL SWITCH (Safety) - 10s
Define when to exit.
> "However, if [Kill Condition] happens, this logic dies instantly. Watch this date."

## 3. Dashboard Card Design

The dashboard must display ONE card per issue.

```markdown
# [TITLE]: [Structural Conflict Headline]

| ELEMENT | CONTENT |
| :--- | :--- |
| **TRIGGER** | [Event] that forced this (Type: A/B/C/D) |
| **PRESSURE** | Why it cannot be delayed (Time/Law/Physics) |
| **SPENDER** | Who creates the budget? |
| **TARGET** | [Ticker 1] [Ticker 2] [Ticker 3] |
| **MOAT** | Why them? (Capacity / Tech / Exclusive) |

> **KILL-SWITCH**: [Condition that invalidates everything]
```

## 4. Mock Example (Locked Topic)

**Input**: Step 8 Candidate (Transformers)

**[TITLE]**
"US 40-Month Lead Time forces Utilities to violate ‘Buy American’."

**[SCRIPT]**
1. **HOOK**: "While the market debates AI software, the physical grid supporting it has just collapsed."
2. **MISUNDERSTANDING**: "Investors think increased production will fix this, but lead times just hit a record 40 months."
3. **STRUCTURE**: "US Utilities are now legally mandated to prevent blackouts, forcing them to buy transformers at any price."
4. **FLOW**: "This panic buying is funneling directly into **HD Hyundai Electric** and **Hyosung**, the only vendors with certified capacity available."
5. **KILL-SWITCH**: "Watch the US DOE Import Policy. If they allow cheap Chinese imports, this thesis ends today."

## 5. Absolute Prohibitions

- Predicting specific price movement ❌
- "This will go up" ❌
- "Strong buy" ❌
- Vague timeline ("Soon") ❌

This engine delivers
**Logic**, not Hope.
