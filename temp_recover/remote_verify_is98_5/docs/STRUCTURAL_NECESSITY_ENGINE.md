# STRUCTURAL_NECESSITY_ENGINE.md
# (Economic Hunter – Step 3)

## 0. Purpose

This engine verifies whether
a confirmed Trigger Confluence
creates unavoidable capital expenditure.

If capital spending is optional,
the Topic is invalid.

---

## 1. Input Requirements

Input must be:
- CONFLUENCE_CONFIRMED
from TRIGGER_CONFLUENCE_ENGINE

Inputs with ambiguity are forbidden.

---

## 2. Core Question

The engine asks ONE question only:

> “Who must spend money now,
> even if they do not want to?”

If no forced spender exists → REJECT

---

## 3. Forced Spender Identification

Valid Forced Spenders:
- Governments
- Regulators
- Infrastructure operators
- Platform owners
- Systemically critical firms

Retail demand is INVALID.

---

## 4. Survival vs Optimization Test

### PASS (Structural)
- Legal compliance
- Safety / reliability
- Capacity replacement
- Sovereignty / security
- System continuity

### FAIL (Non-Structural)
- Cost reduction
- Efficiency improvement
- Market opportunity
- Competitive advantage

If the motive is optimization → REJECT

---

## 5. No-Delay Test (Timing Gate)

Spending must satisfy at least one:
- Legal deadline exists
- Physical bottleneck already visible
- System failure risk within 12 months

“If they can wait” → REJECT

---

## 6. Output Format

[STRUCTURAL_VERDICT]

- Forced Spender:
- Reason for No-Delay:
- What breaks if not spent:
- Spending Category (generic, not sector)

Only PASS outputs
may proceed to Step 4 (Bottleneck Engine).

---

## 7. Absolute Prohibitions

- Sector naming ❌
- Company guessing ❌
- Investment framing ❌
- Price implication ❌

This engine proves necessity,
not opportunity.
