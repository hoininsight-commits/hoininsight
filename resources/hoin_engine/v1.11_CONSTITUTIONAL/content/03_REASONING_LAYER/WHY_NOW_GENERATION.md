## GOAL
Explain "Why Must It Be NOW?" not "Why Is It Good?".

## TRIGGER TYPES (Hierarchy)

### 1. Hybrid (Structural + Capital) [HIGHEST PRIORITY]
- **Definition**: A structural event (e.g., Lock-up expiry) coincides with a Capital event (e.g., Block deal volume).
- **Reasoning**: "Structure opened the door, and Capital walked in."
- **Use Case**: M&A, Policy Change, Regime Shift.

### 2. Schedule-driven
- **Definition**: Fixed calendar date (Earnings, FOMC, Expiry).
- **Reasoning**: "Inevitability of time."
- **Use Case**: Earnings shock, Option expiry.

### 3. State-driven
- **Definition**: Macro/Industry state reached a tipping point (e.g., Oversold, Divergence).
- **Reasoning**: "Elasticity limit reached."
- **Use Case**: Rebound, Crash, Rotation.
