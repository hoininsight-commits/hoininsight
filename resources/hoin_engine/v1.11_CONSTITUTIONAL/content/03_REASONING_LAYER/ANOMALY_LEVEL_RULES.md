# ANOMALY_LEVEL_RULES.md

## LEVEL DEFINITIONS (General)
- **L1 (Observation)**: Signal detected, no trend.
- **L2 (Attention)**: Trend formed, or multi-sensor activation.
- **L3 (Warning)**: Clear direction + Structural/Capital confirmation.
- **L4 (Critical/Fixed)**: Structure is locked-in, Capital is committed.

## [S-LEVEL CHECKLIST] (Structural Branch Special)

### S-L3 (Reconfiguration)
- [ ] Is there a "Structural Event" (e.g., M&A, Spin-off, Law)?
- [ ] Is Capital flowing in (Volume/RS)?
- [ ] BUT, is the deal/event still "Pending" or "Probabilistic"?
-> If YES to all, it is **S-L3**.

### S-L4 (Valuation Reset)
- [ ] Is the Deal/Policy **Mandatory/Irreversible**?
- [ ] Has Capital fully accepted the **New Valuation Multiple**?
- [ ] Is the downside limited by structural floors (e.g., Put option, Gov Guarantee)?
-> If YES to all, it is **S-L4**.

## RULE OF THUMB
- **When in doubt, stay at S-L3.**
- S-L4 is only for "Guaranteed" structural shifts (e.g., Law passed, Deal signed, Capital deployed).
