# Walkthrough - RUN_DATE Cohesion and Dashboard Standardization

We have standardized the date handling across the HOIN ENGINE to ensure all artifacts produced in a single run share the same `RUN_YMD` (KST, UTC+9). This ensures the dashboard correctly links to the latest decision data without stale or mismatched paths.

## Changes Made

### 1. RUN_DATE/RUN_YMD Standardization
- **[target\_date.py](file:///Users/jihopa/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/HoinInsight/src/utils/target_date.py)**: Updated to use **KST (UTC+9)** as the default for `get_target_ymd()`.
- **[engine.py](file:///Users/jihopa/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/HoinInsight/src/engine.py)**: Revised to use standardized `RUN_YMD` for folder creation and artifact generation.

### 2. Artifact and Dashboard Alignment
- **[decision\_dashboard.md](file:///Users/jihopa/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/HoinInsight/data/reports/2026/01/26/decision_dashboard.md)**: Now explicitly generated by the engine and saved in the daily report folder.
- **[latest\_run.json](file:///Users/jihopa/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/HoinInsight/data/dashboard/latest_run.json)**: Updated manifest to point `decision_md` to the new `decision_dashboard.md`.
- **[health\_today.json](file:///Users/jihopa/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/HoinInsight/data/dashboard/health_today.json)**: Implementation in `health_check.py` now scans real artifact paths and reports errors if counts are zero or files are missing.

### 3. Cleanup and Verification
- Standardized date handling in `daily_report.py`, `data_snapshot.py`, and `health.py`.
- Verified Dashboard UI cohesion with the new manifest structure.

## How to interpret events_count == 0

When `events_count` is 0, the system now provides an **Input Status** code in the dashboard:

- **OUTPUT_EMPTY_VALID**: No events were detected today, but the pipeline executed correctly. This is a "real no-topic day".
- **FETCH_FAILED**: The registry has enabled sources, but no output was generated. This suggests a network issue or a pipeline crash.
- **SOURCE_REGISTRY_MISSING/EMPTY**: The configuration that defines where to get events is missing or has no active sources.
- **PARSE_FAILED**: An error occurred while reading the `events.json` file.
- **OUTPUT_PATH_MISSING**: The file doesn't exist and the registry check was inconclusive.

## Step 32: Live Run Verification & Operator Closure

We verified the end-to-end pipeline in GitHub Actions (Run ID: 21345027092).

### Verification Evidence
- **RUN_YMD**: 2026-01-26
- **Events Count**: 0
- **Input Status**: `FETCH_FAILED` (Correctly diagnosed due to active registry but missing output)
- **Operator Closure**: The dashboard correctly displays: `🚨 오늘은 이벤트 입력이 0건이라 토픽 생성이 불가능합니다. (ROOT: FETCH_FAILED)`

## Step 33: Event Coverage & Last-Seen Monitor

We implemented an event coverage monitoring system to make "event input missing" fully diagnosable.

### Key Deliverables
- **Coverage Builder**: `src/ops/event_coverage.py` scans artifacts and computes source freshness.
- **Pipeline Integration**: Automatically runs after health check in `full_pipeline.yml`.
- **Dashboard Panel**: New "EVENT COVERAGE" tab with dynamic loading and operator hints.

### Verification Evidence
- **Global Flags**: `NO_EVENTS_ALL` correctly triggered when today's events are zero.
- **Last Seen**: Correctly identifies `2026-01-24` as the last valid date for all registered sources.
- **Operator Hint**: Dashboard displays: `💡 입력 이벤트 0건 — 소스 스톨 / 경로 / 스케줄 문제 가능성`

## Step 34: Shadow Candidate Pool (Continuity Layer)

We implemented a "Shadow Candidate Pool" to provide continuity and preparation for topics that are structurally promising but not yet speakable.

### Key Deliverables
- **Shadow Builder**: `src/ops/shadow_candidate_builder.py` identifies eligible topics (HOLD/DROP, Fact-driven or Structural, Non-immediate).
- **Preparation Pool**: Topics are stored with explicit "Promotion Triggers" (e.g., additional evidence or signal confirmation).
- **Conditional Rendering**: The dashboard renders this section only when `READY < 3`, ensuring the operator always has a look-ahead even when today's output is low.

### Verification Evidence
- **Eligibility**: Topics rejected for critical reasons (TITLE_MISMATCH) or purely placeholder evidence are correctly excluded.
- **Visuals**: Section uses grey tones (◽ 🔘) and explicit "NOT FOR NARRATION YET" labels.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_shadow_candidate_builder.py` passes 3/3.

## Step 35: Shadow → Trigger Map (Promotion Readiness)

We enhanced the Shadow Candidate Pool by mapping each candidate to specific actionable triggers, transforming the pool into a promotion-readiness map.

### Key Deliverables
- **Trigger Map Builder**: `src/ops/trigger_map.py` defines a `TRIGGER_ENUM` (e.g., `NUMERIC_EVIDENCE_APPEAR`, `SUPPORTING_ANOMALY_DETECTED`) and maps failure codes to these triggers.
- **Actionable Hints**: Each shadow candidate now lists what logic is missing, where the evidence is expected from (e.g., earnings release), and when it will be re-checked (e.g., `WINDOW_OPEN`).
- **Dashboard Extended**: The "SHADOW CANDIDATES" section now includes a "PROMOTION READINESS" block for each candidate, aiding operator look-ahead.

### Verification Evidence
- **Deterministic Mapping**: Failure codes like `LOW_EVIDENCE` consistently map to `NUMERIC_EVIDENCE_APPEAR`.
- **UI Consistency**: Grey-toned rendering maintained with explicit "Still NOT for narration" labels.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_trigger_map.py` passes 4/4.

## Step 36: Shadow Aging & Decay Guard

We introduced an aging and decay monitoring system for shadow candidates to prevent "silent rotting" and maintain operational hygiene.

### Key Deliverables
- **Aging Calculator**: `src/ops/shadow_aging.py` classifies candidates into `FRESH`, `STALE`, `DECAYING`, or `EXPIRED` based on first-seen duration.
- **Lookback Integration**: `ShadowCandidateBuilder` now scans 60 days of history to determine the `first_seen_date` for each shadow topic.
- **Aging Summary Panel**: A high-level overview of the shadow pool's "health" (FRESH vs. EXPIRED) displayed at the top of the shadow section.
- **Enhanced Cards**: Shadow cards now explicitly display their age and a governance hint (e.g., ⚠️ `DECAYING`, 🧊 `EXPIRED`).

### Verification Evidence
- **Deterministic Buckets**: Verified correct classification boundaries (7d, 21d, 45d) via `tests/test_shadow_aging.py`.
- **Governance Hints**: Visual rules properly applied (warnings for stale topics, fading for expired ones).
- **Tests**: `tests/test_shadow_aging.py` passed.

## Step 37: Signal Watchlist (Input Monitoring)

We transformed the Shadow Pool into an explicit Signal Watchlist, making it clear to the operator what specific data triggers the engine is waiting for.

### Key Deliverables
- **Watchlist Builder**: `src/ops/signal_watchlist.py` uses a fixed `WATCH_SIGNAL_ENUM` (e.g., `EARNINGS_RELEASE`, `ONCHAIN_CONFIRMATION`) to monitor shadow candidates.
- **Global Monitoring Panel**: A new dashboard section, `GLOBAL SIGNAL WATCHLIST`, aggregates all pending signals across the shadow pool, providing high-level operational awareness.
- **Signal-Specific Blocks**: Each shadow candidate card now includes a `SIGNAL WATCHLIST` block that details exactly which signals are missing and when the next recheck is scheduled.

### Verification Evidence
- **Enum Determinism**: All watch signals are mapped from a strict enum based on deterministic rules and source hints.
- **Aging Preservation**: Shadow aging and decay status are correctly maintained alongside the new watchlist metadata.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_signal_watchlist.py` passed with 4/4 assertions.

## Step 38: Signal Arrival ↔ Shadow Matching

We connected the shadow monitoring watchlist with the actual pipeline outputs, allowing the system to automatically detect when a "waiting-for" signal has actually arrived.

### Key Deliverables
- **Signal Arrival Matcher**: `src/ops/signal_arrival_matcher.py` scans today's artifacts (e.g., `events.json`, `daily_snapshot.json`) to detect signal arrivals (e.g., `EARNINGS_RELEASE`, `NUMERIC_EVIDENCE_APPEAR`).
- **Matching Intelligence**: The shadow builder now automatically compares watchlists against arrived signals, attaching clear match status to each candidate.
- **Signal Status UI**: Shadow cards now feature a `SIGNAL STATUS` block with icons (✅ Arrived / ⏳ Still waiting).
- **Global Arrival Panel**: A new `SIGNAL ARRIVAL TODAY` panel provides a high-level summary of which monitored signals were satisfied today.

### Verification Evidence
- **Source Integrity**: Arrivals are triggered only by explicit artifact presence or content (e.g., searching for "earnings" in events).
- **Matching Determinism**: Verified that shadow candidates correctly reflect their specific match status via `tests/test_signal_arrival_matcher.py`.
- **No Promotion**: Confirmed that signal arrival does NOT auto-promote topics to READY, maintaining human-in-the-loop control.
- **Tests**: 3/3 tests passed.
