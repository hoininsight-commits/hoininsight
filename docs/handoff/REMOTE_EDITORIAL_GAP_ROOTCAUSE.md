# Remote Editorial Gap Root Cause
## 1. Issue Description 
The user found that while `today.json` contains `narrative_score`s (and other UI meta fields like `video_ready`), the historical and current day `editorial_selection_YYYY-MM-DD.json` files entirely lack these fields on the remote GitHub Pages.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis
By exclusively investigating the Python UI Asset publishing adapter (`src/ui/run_publish_ui_decision_assets.py`), the root cause is confirmed to be **CASE E2: narrative 레이어는 적용되지만 publish 단계에서 editorial은 병합 대상에서 제외됨.**

The `_publish_editorial()` function currently reads:
```python
    for src in sorted(DATA_EDITORIAL.glob("editorial_selection_*.json")):
        ...
        try:
            ed_data = json.loads(dest.read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
            changed = False
            for pick in ed_data.get("picks", []):
                pick_title = pick.get("theme") or pick.get("title")
                if pick_title in approved_titles:
                    pick["status"] = "APPROVED"
                    changed = True
```

As clearly shown in the source code, `_publish_editorial()` limits its logic exclusively to merging `approved_titles` (Gate validations) and totally ignores the `narrative_map` outputs generated by the Narrative Intelligence Layer. The Engine correctly processes and assigns scores to Candidate signals, but the publisher fails to pipe them into the structural `editorial` output files that the UI relies on for its history and list renders.

## 3. Resolution Plan
The fix does not require altering the scoring formulas or thresholds.
I will augment `_publish_editorial()` to load `_load_narrative_data()` and map `narrative_score`, `actor_tier_score`, `video_ready`, `conflict_flag`, etc. into each `pick` inside `editorial_selection_*.json` just like it currently does for `today.json`.
