# HUNTER_NARRATIVE_SYNTHESIZER.md
# (Economic Hunter – Step 11)

## 0. Purpose

This engine is the final translator.
It converts the rigid `LOCKED_TICKER_CARD` into
a structured narrative that a human can present.

It does not add information.
It organizes it for impact.

---

## 1. One-Line Hunter Thesis (Mandatory)

Every Locked Topic must produce **ONE** sentence following this syntax:

> "Because **[TRIGGER]**, **[FORCED_SPENDER]** is forced to inject capital into **[BOTTLENECK]**, which is exclusively controlled by **[TICKERS]**."

*Constraint:*
If this sentence cannot be formed logically → **REJECT TOPIC**.

---

## 2. Title Generator (The 3-Type Rule)

The engine must generate exactly 3 title options for the human operator.

### Option A: The FACT Title
Focus on the event itself.
> "US Senate passes $50B Grid Act."

### Option B: The MECHANISM Title
Focus on the structural collision.
> "40-Month Lead Time Collision: Grid vs AI."

### Option C: The HUNTER Title
Focus on the scarcity/bottleneck (The Engine's Choice).
> "Only 2 Companies can solve the US Grid Crisis."

*Rule: No emotion, no hype. Just structure.*

## 3. Script Skeleton (6-Section Fixed)

The narrative script must fill these slots.

| Section | Time | Content Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. THE HOOK** | 00:00-00:10 | Contradict a common market belief. "People think X, but Y is happening." |
| **2. THE CONTEXT** | 00:10-00:20 | Explain the *Misunderstanding*. Why is the price not up yet? |
| **3. THE TRIGGER** | 00:20-00:30 | State the *Irreversible Event* (Step 1/2) that changed the game. |
| **4. THE MECHANISM** | 00:30-00:40 | Trace the *Forced Capital* (Step 3). Money must go where? |
| **5. THE TARGET** | 00:40-00:50 | Reveal the *Bottleneck* (Step 4/5). Who catches the money? |
| **6. THE EXIT** | 00:50-01:00 | Define the *Kill-Switch*. When does this logic break? |

## 4. NO_TOPIC Narrative (The Empty State)

If Day Harvest (Step 8) returns 0 topics, use this template.

**Headline**: "No Structural Anomalies Detected."
**Sub-text**: "Markets are efficient today. No forced capital flows identified."
**Action**: "Monitor Watchlist. Do not force a trade."

*Reasoning*: Silence is better than Noise.

---

## 5. Mock Example (LOCKED Topic)

**Status**: LOCKED
**Trigger**: US DOE prohibits Chinese Transformers (Policy).

**[One-Line Thesis]**
"Because the US DOE banned Chinese imports, US Utilities are forced to inject capital into Non-China UHV Transformers, which are exclusively controlled by HD Hyundai Electric and Hyosung."

**[Titles]**
- **FACT**: "US DOE Issues Official Ban on 69kV+ Chinese Transformers."
- **MECHANISM**: "Supply Shock: Non-China Transformer Capacity Sold Out Until 2029."
- **HUNTER**: "The Hidden Beneficiaries of the US Grid War."

**[Script Draft]**
- **Hook**: "Everyone is buying AI chips, but they forgot the plug."
- **Context**: "AI data centers need 3x power, but grid equipment is sold out."
- **Trigger**: "Last night, US DOE banned the only alternative: Chinese transformers."
- **Mechanism**: "This forces US utilities to buy from allies only, regardless of price."
- **Target**: "Order books at HD Hyundai Electric are now full for 4 years."
- **Exit**: "Unless the ban is lifted, this supply squeeze is mathematical."

---

## 6. Mock Example (NO_TOPIC)

**Status**: EMPTY

**[One-Line Thesis]**
"No irreversible triggers detected in today's macro or policy flow."

**[Titles]**
- **FACT**: "Market Digest: Consolidating Phase."
- **MECHANISM**: "Volatility Compression: Waiting for Catalyst."
- **HUNTER**: "No Prey Found. Staying in Cash."

**[Script Draft]**
- **Hook**: "Sometimes, the best trade is no trade."
- **Context**: "Today's news flow is purely noise and opinion."
- **Trigger**: "No policy or shock has moved the structural needle."
- **Target**: "We preserve capital for the next clear anomaly."

## 7. Absolute Prohibitions

- "It feels like..." ❌
- "I think..." ❌
- "Maybe..." ❌
- "To the moon!" ❌

The Hunter speaks in **Constraints**, not Possibilities.
